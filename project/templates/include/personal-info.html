<p>
  I like art, science and techological progress. Iâ€™ve chosen architecture because they meet and mix in it.
</p>
<p>
  Professional interests: wooden architecture, ergonomics, parametric and generative design, contemporary design, history of design, sustainability.<br />
  I like working with wood, because it is very warm, humane and expressionistic material.<br />
  My artistic dream is to design a house, where everything from architecture to furniture will be created by myself.
